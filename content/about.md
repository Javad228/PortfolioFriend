# About Me

Welcome to my pixel universe! I'm a passionate digital artist specializing in pixel art and retro-style game graphics. With over 5 years of experience, I've mastered the art of creating compelling visuals within the constraints of limited resolution and color palettes.

My journey began with classic 8-bit and 16-bit games, which inspired me to pursue this unique art form. I believe that limitations breed creativity, and every pixel has its purpose in telling a story.

From character sprites to environmental tiles, UI elements to animated sequences, I bring ideas to life one pixel at a time. Each project is a new adventure in digital craftsmanship.
